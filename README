You will need g++ the GNU C++ compiler, as tchatd is a C++ program. The reason I
had chosen to write this in C++ is because I required the performance of a
compiled language while the convenience of OOP and STL. Simply typing 'make'
should compile this for you. './tchatd -h' should provide you with enough
configuration information. This software is currently in early development.
